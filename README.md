  Clone with the SSH Key:

  Install NPM Inquirer in Node:
  npm i inquirer

  Both are needed to run the program.

  ## Usage
  * When the user runs the program in node, they are prompted to answer a set of questions.
  * Once the user answers all questions, a new readme file called newREADME.md  is created with the information they provided. 
  * I am still working to get the badge of the license chosen to display.
